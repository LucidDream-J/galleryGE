   <p>During my time in China, I became extremely interested in Chinese ancient mythology. My first series concentrated on the Chinese gods, but in this current series, I have looked at the mythological coupling of flora and fauna, which can forecast good omens for the owners of the artworks. For this series I use computer applications to create and paint the images. The background colours were inspired by the artworks of Roger Dean and are variable.</p>
   <p>While living in New York State, I began the shadow series and continued the set after I went to China. This sampling is meant to depict humorous situations, using shadows as the subject. The initial concept was inspired by the photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson, and again, I have used computer applications to create and paint the images. </p>
   <p>The artwork, The Cycle of Life-Birth was inspired by a dream.‚Äù</p>
